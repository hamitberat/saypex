The previous AI engineer successfully executed a multi-phase development trajectory. Initially, a pixel-perfect YouTube clone frontend was built using React and mock data, validating the UI/UX through extensive screenshot-based testing. Subsequently, an enterprise-grade FastAPI backend with MongoDB was implemented, utilizing a service and repository pattern. This phase involved resolving multiple technical challenges, including Pydantic V2 compatibility, Python import errors, and MongoDB connection nuances. After successful backend and frontend integration, the project transitioned. The current phase involves transforming the application into SAYPEX, incorporating a new design (blue/purple palette, 3x3 grid, relaxed fonts), fixing a reported video playback error, and implementing functionalities outlined in a new Product Specification, which includes authentication. The engineer is actively engaged in this transformation.

<product_requirements>
The user's initial problem was to create a YouTube clone with all of its systems included such as machine learning, UI design, abiding by system design principles. This involved replicating YouTube's UI (header, sidebar, video grid, video player, search, trending, comments) as closely as possible, first with mock data, then with a functional backend.

The product requirements evolved after the YouTube clone was functionally complete:
1.  **Fix a specific error** on the video watch page (screenshot provided).
2.  Ensure **all clickable objects perform their function**.
3.  **Rebrand the website to SAYPEX**:
    *   Implement a **3x3 grid for videos** on the homepage.
    *   Use a **blue and purple color palette**.
    *   Utilize **more relaxed fonts**.
4.  Implement all functionalities detailed in the **Product Specification.docx**. This document implies a comprehensive social media video platform utilizing no-trust to user input, to protect website from cyberattacks. It also specifies user authentication (login/signup) and an enterprise-grade approach for backend development including machine learning for recommendations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI Framework**: Shadcn UI components for modern, responsive design.
-   **Backend Patterns**: Repository pattern, Service layer for enterprise-grade structure.
-   **Data Validation**: Pydantic for API request/response and database models.
-   **Routing**: React Router DOM (frontend), FastAPI APIRouter (backend).
-   **API Communication**: Axios (frontend), Uvicorn (backend server).
-   **System Management**: Supervisor (process control for frontend/backend).
-   **Deployment Strategy**: Kubernetes Ingress rules for API routing ( prefix).
-   **ML**: Collaborative filtering for recommendations (planned).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack monorepo within the  directory, containing  (React) and  (FastAPI) services.



-   : The main FastAPI application entry point. It sets up CORS, includes API routers, and connects to MongoDB.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup, later fixed import errors (relative imports to absolute with  manipulation), and adjusted MongoDB connection parameters ( issue).
-   : Defines Pydantic models for , , and  data structures, mapping them to MongoDB documents.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored for Pydantic V2 compatibility, addressing  and regex field validation.
-   : Implements the repository pattern for database interactions (CRUD operations) for , , and  models, abstracting MongoDB access.
    -   **Changes**: New files created to encapsulate database logic.
-   : Implements the service layer, containing business logic and coordinating interactions between repositories and API controllers. Includes .
    -   **Changes**: New files created to define application-specific logic.
-   : Contains FastAPI  definitions for different resource endpoints (videos, users, comments, auth). These expose the business logic from the service layer via HTTP APIs.
    -   **Changes**: New files created to define API routes and their handlers.
-   : The main React application component, handling client-side routing using .
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup, updated to include routes for , , , , and later ,  pages, and adjusted API calls from mock to real backend.
-   : Defines the main page components of the application, such as  (video grid),  (video player), , , , and .
    -   **Changes**: Initially built with mock data, later updated to fetch data from the backend APIs. Significant recent changes for SAYPEX transformation (layout, styling, new authentication pages, video grid on homepage).
-   : Reusable UI components like , , , .
    -   **Changes**: Built to match YouTube's design, updated for SAYPEX branding (colors, fonts, layout), and integrated with backend data.  specifically needs 3x3 grid adjustment for SAYPEX.
-   : Contains hardcoded mock data for videos and comments used during frontend-only development.
    -   **Changes**: Largely deprecated after backend integration, but its structure guided backend model creation.
-   : A new service layer on the frontend to centralize API calls to the FastAPI backend, replacing direct  calls in components.
    -   **Changes**: New file created to manage API interactions.
-   : A documentation file outlining API contracts, database models, integration plan, and machine learning strategy.
    -   **Changes**: Created by the AI engineer after frontend completion to guide backend development.
-   : A temporary script to seed the MongoDB database with initial video data.
    -   **Changes**: Created to overcome issues with the more complex  script.

The codebase adheres to the React and FastAPI best practices, using component-based development for the frontend and a clear separation of concerns (models, repositories, services, API) for the backend.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete implementation of all functionalities outlined in the Product Specification.docx for SAYPEX.
-   Implement machine learning recommendations (collaborative filtering).
-   Ensure all clickable objects perform their functions, beyond just UI updates.
-   Full user authentication system (beyond just login/signup UI).
-   Comprehensive backend testing after the current SAYPEX changes.
-   Finalizing the blue/purple color palette and relaxed fonts across the entire SAYPEX application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively transforming the application from a YouTube clone into SAYPEX based on the user's updated requirements. This work is ongoing and involves:

1.  **Addressing a screenshot error**: The engineer identified an error on the video watch page (likely related to data handling or rendering) and initiated fixes in . This indicates a focus on ensuring video playback functionality is robust.
2.  **SAYPEX Branding and UI Rework**:
    *   **Homepage Grid**: The user explicitly requested a 3x3 grid for videos in the homepage. This requires modifications to  and potentially  to adjust layout and styling.
    *   **Color Palette and Fonts**: The application's styling is being changed to use a blue and purple color palette and more relaxed fonts. This involves updates across various frontend files, including global CSS ( or ) and component-specific styles.
    *   **New Pages**: The engineer has started creating core authentication pages, specifically  and . This is a foundational step towards implementing the Product Specification which implies user management.
    *   **Component Updates**: Existing components like , , and  are being modified to align with the new SAYPEX design and potentially integrate new functionalities (e.g., login/signup buttons in the header).
    *   **Page Updates**:  and  are also being updated, likely to conform to the new SAYPEX branding and ensure consistency across the application.
3.  **Overall Functionality**: The general instruction to make any clickable object perform its function means that beyond UI changes, underlying event handlers and API integrations (where applicable for the new SAYPEX features) are being addressed.

The current state is mid-transformation, with several frontend files being written or modified in batches to implement the SAYPEX look and feel and new authentication pages. The last action was writing 3 files (, , ) related to this transformation and attempting a screenshot to evaluate the progress.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Evaluate the recent screenshot of the SAYPEX transformation to identify remaining UI/UX adjustments and continue implementing the new design, focusing on the 3x3 grid and specified color palette/fonts, as well as integrating the new Login/Signup pages.
