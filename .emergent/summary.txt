The previous AI engineer successfully brought the application from an initial MVP state to a feature-rich video platform named Lotic. The work trajectory began with foundational improvements like migrating from Yarn to npm and removing unnecessary frontend dependencies (Radix UI and CRACO). Subsequently, the engineer addressed several user experience enhancements: fixing search functionality, standardizing video duration display, and rectifying sidebar navigation issues. A significant re-branding from Saypex to Lotic was executed, accompanied by a major layout overhaul, introducing a permanent icon-only sidebar, a profile dropdown, and a redesigned video watch page.

Despite a temporary halt in the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration due to environmental constraints, the engineer pivoted to creating Vercel deployment configurations. The bulk of recent work focused on refining the user interface and functionality, including implementing mock data for the video watch page, removing redundant elements, enhancing search bar interactions, integrating rich engagement metrics (heart/broken heart emojis, dislike counts, preview statistics), and adding content moderation features like a video report system. The latest interaction involves a detailed request to implement a new logo and color palette, which the AI engineer has commenced working on. The approach has been iterative, with constant user feedback integration and thorough testing.

<product_requirements>
The initial application was a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB MVP, implicitly a video platform.
**Phase 1: Foundation & Cleanup**
The user requested converting the project to use npm instead of Yarn and removing unnecessary frontend dependencies, specifically  components and  configuration, while maintaining full functionality.
**Phase 2: Core Functionality & UI Fixes**
Implement search bar to find videos by keywords, correct video duration display (e.g., 333:56 to 5:33:56), and fix the non-functional sidebar category navigation. Categories were later updated from Music, Gaming, Sports, Learning to Trending, Gaming, Cooking, Mukbang, Daily (with Daily as new). A sliding animation for the sidebar toggle was also requested.
**Phase 3: Rebranding & Major Layout Overhaul**
Rebrand the application from Saypex to Lotic. The video watching page should display comments on the right side and recommended videos beneath the main video container. The main page sidebar needs to be a permanent, icon-only navigation, with the explore section removed. A user profile picture with a pop-up menu (including signup) should be on the top right. Shorts content requires vertical and central alignment, showing account name (hyperlink), description, and hashtags at the bottom left, and like/comment buttons with counts, plus a preview button (with statistics) at the bottom right.
**Phase 4: Infrastructure & Deployment (Deferred)**
Migrate user and video data from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and deploy the application to Vercel, including necessary schemas. (Actual migration was deferred; deployment configurations were created.)
**Phase 5: UI Refinements & Engagement**
Demonstrate video watching page with mock data. Remove duplicate comments section. Remove Welcome to Lotic and Ready to share your story promotional sections. Refine search bar: remove redundant search icon, enable Enter key search. Replace like/dislike symbols with heart/broken heart emojis. Add preview statistics (taps, watched, rate) to Shorts. Implement a three dots menu on video watch page for Report video (with specific reasons) and Not interested, and remove Preview text from Shorts (keep count). Implement user's exact image as preview icon. Add dislike counts. Update website logo to a provided image and align the entire color palette (from purple-blue to pink-blue gradient).

<current_work>
The most recent work involved a comprehensive update to the website's branding and aesthetics. The AI engineer was tasked with changing the website logo to a specific image provided by the user, and subsequently updating the entire color palette of the website to align with the new logo's pink-to-blue gradient.

**Specifically:**
- The logo in  was updated.
- Widespread color changes were applied across various components to transition from the previous purple-blue theme to a new pink-to-blue gradient with pink accent colors. This included:
    - **Header components**: Search button, profile dropdown hover states, avatar backgrounds.
    - **Navigation elements**: Sidebar active states, hover colors, icon colors, Home page category buttons.
    - **Interactive components**: Watch page subscribe buttons and action buttons.

The AI engineer has performed numerous file edits (, , , ) to apply these color changes, restarting the frontend service after the modifications. A screenshot was provided to the user, demonstrating the updated logo and color palette throughout the application, which showed a successful transformation.

The very last user message explicitly stated: I want you to use the exact image for logo I attached it here. This indicates the previous SVG recreation of the logo, or its integration, was not precise enough, or a new image was provided. The AI engineer's last action confirms understanding this request and is preparing to update the logo to match the *exact* image provided by the user.

<optional_next_step>
I will implement the exact logo image provided by the user into the  component.
